# RESPONSIVE_RULES.md — Zoning App (Mobile/Tablet/Desktop)



## Breakpoints

- Mobile: <= 640px

- Tablet: 641px–1024px

- Desktop: >= 1025px



## Global Rules

- Minimum tap target: 44px

- Avoid two-column text on mobile (stack vertically)

- Use progressive disclosure: “Show more” / accordions / bottom sheets

- Keep map usable on all devices



## Landing Page Responsiveness

### Desktop

- Full hero layout:

  - Top center pill search

  - Floating stat cards on right

  - Big glass hero card bottom-left



### Tablet

- Reduce spacing:

  - Stat cards move to a 2-column grid near the center/right

  - Hero card stays prominent but smaller

  - Search remains at top but slightly shorter



### Mobile

- Background image stays full-bleed

- Top row:

  - Left menu circle

  - Center compact search (still pill)

  - Right icons in a row (or inside menu)

- Stat cards become a vertical stack (or horizontal swipe)

- Hero card becomes full-width bottom sheet style:

  - big title

  - short text

  - primary CTA



## Authenticated App Responsiveness



### Desktop (>= 1025px)

- Sidebar visible with icons + labels

- Top bar always visible

- Property page uses 3-panel layout:

  - Left: property summary cards

  - Center: map

  - Right: AI chat + feasibility snapshot



### Tablet (641px–1024px)

- Sidebar collapses to icon-only OR becomes a drawer

- Property page becomes 2-panel:

  - Other panels open via tabs or drawers

- Keep top bar search visible



### Mobile (<= 640px)

- Sidebar becomes:

  - Hamburger drawer OR bottom navigation (use what fits existing app)

- Property page:

  - Map is full-width primary view

  - Use bottom sheets for:

    - Layers

    - Property details

    - AI chat

    - Feasibility snapshot

- “Layers” button is always accessible as a floating action button or top action

- Cards stack vertically with generous spacing



## Map UX on Small Screens
